TRACKLIST

1. Cute - DRAM
	Probably one of the cheesiest songs ever made. If I'm ever in a cheesy mood this is kind of the perfect song. It always makes me think about how smitten I am with you and it never gets old. 

"I choose you now you have to deal, but you're so cute you can make me chill."

2. It's Not Living (If It's Not With You) - The 1975
	The name just about says it all. This is a great song for when I'm missing you a lot or I feel stressed. You've been my mental escape a lot this past year and this song always helps me think of that.

"Distract my brain from the terrible news, it's not living if it's not with you."

3. Super Natural - Turnover
	One of the lighter Turnover songs out there. The song is about how love can feel like a much bigger thing, something that you can't even really explain, hence "Super Natural." It's impossible not to think about you when I listen to this song because that's exactly how loving you feels. It brings me more peace and relaxation than anything else.

"I could try but I can't explain how I do, I just know it. It's something supernatural."

4. November - Tyler, the Creator
	November in this song is a representation of the best time/event/person in a person's life. Without question I feel like you're my November. This is another song that really hits when I'm missing you a lot, especially when I'm having a hard time. Tyler talks about his November as something where he was worry free and that has always reflected on myself as well. I'm never more stress and worry free than when I'm with you.

"My November was summer 2015, when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up."

5. OTW - Khalid, 6LACK & Ty Dolla $ign
	I listened to this song almost on repeat on my way to Wisconsin for the first time. Any time I've listened to it since then I think about that happy anxiousness I had/have before I see you again. This is another song that I think will never get old for me just because of the feeling I get from it. 

"You can meet me in five I'll be all night, I'll be all day."

6. Pretty Little Fears (feat. J. Cole) - 6LACK
	J. Cole's verse in this song has always stuck with me. Pretty much every sentiment he has for his wife in this song I have for you. His verse is a good representation of the gratefulness I have for you being in my life and everything you do for me. 

"I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name."

7. Best Part (feat. H.E.R.) - Daniel Caesar
	Similar to the DRAM song, this song is super cheesy but in a much more romantic way than goofy way. This song always makes me think of how I feel like I need you in my life and how much I love you in the most cheesy way possible.

"You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert, you're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts."

8. SAN MARCOS - BROCKHAMPTON
	My favorite song of this past year, I could probably write an essay on what this song as a whole means to me. To me this song takes me back to the period of time before we got close and how wanting to change and opening myself up, particularly to you, improved my life immensely. This song is all about struggling and changing for the better and it's written so well that every line of the song hits for me. Joba's verse in particular really hits, when he talks about his problems with his mental health and trying to change for the better for himself and someone else in his life. The song reminds me of how much of a positive impact you've had on my life both directly and indirectly for a long time now, and how I truly don't know where I'd be without you. 

"Appreciate your patience, I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless"

9. Moon River - Frank Ocean
	At the risk of sounding lame, the vibe of this song is really what reminds me of you/us. I remember listening to this a lot last Valentine's Day when we first decided to call each other. Back then it made me think a lot about how I wish I could be there with you, and now it makes me think about everything we have to look forward to in the near future when we'll finally be together permanently. 

"Wherever you're going, I'm going the same."

10. Soco Amaretto Lime - Brand New
	This song reminds me of the "on top of the world" feeling I get when I'm with you, how I feel like we could do anything we ever set our minds to, and how I never want that feeling to go away. It's one of my favorite all-time songs easily.

"They're just jealous cause we're young and in love."
